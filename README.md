## 💼 About Me

After 6+ years as a teacher and IT administrator, I made a bold leap into the world of **data science**. I believe that data tells powerful stories — and I love finding them.

Currently working on:
- 🔍 Real-world data analysis projects (Banking & Airbnb)
- 📊 Building Tableau dashboards
- 🤖 Learning ML to build predictive models
